*Italics* → Needs attention

- Use ~~an alternating flag~~ *collision detection* (distance to projected point) to draw the pathtrace in a separate PGraphics object as the background

~~- This could be done adding "Punch In/Out" nodes in the Grid structure!~~ (The less I node, the better)

~~- Be smarter about when to flip a flag (maybe do some research into formal knot theory?)~~ (Not needed right now, but very welcome)

- Collision = Pathtrace Point → This leads to less work on rendering and creates nice, continuous lines
