- Add "Pilot" object
- Separate pilot velocity between x and y
- Test x and y collisions separately
- Since collision nothing more is than inverting velocity in a certain point, check which boudary has been crossed and invert that direction
- Use an alternating flag to draw pathtrace in a separate PGraphics object as the background
